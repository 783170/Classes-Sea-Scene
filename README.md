# Classes-Sea-Scene
We started this project by learning about the concept of chemotaxis and then were told to replicate that motion in our code, using random slight variations. Then we learned about the concept of object oriented programing and learned how to write classes.

Chemotaxis
+ The movement of a motile cell or organism, or part of one, in a direction corresponding to a gradient of increasing or decreasing concentration of a particular substance.

+ In this project we learned about classes
    + Class names are capitalized
    + A class is used as the bluprint for an object, objects are created based on their constructors
    + An object can have a function performed on it using the dot operator
    + The "this" keyword refers to the variables/functions of the class to remove confusion between attribute and parameters of the same name
    + Classes can extend other classes and inherite there methods - use keyword "extends"
        + A class can have multiple children (be extended multiple time), but only one parent (be extended directly from one class)
        + A class can have its own versions of a parent method through the process of overwriting
        + A child can make a call to its parent using the keyword super
+ I applied this information by creating a class called SeaCreature with four subclass (Fish, Puffer, Seahourse, and Shark)
+ I had a lot of fun:
    +  playing with curves and arcs to create unique shapes in the Shark
    +  creating bobbing movement using a sine wave for the Seahorse
    +  making the puffer fish grow as it moved across the window
    +  craeting color variation in my original fish
