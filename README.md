# Movement-Sea-Scene
We started this project by learning about the concept of chemotaxis and then were told to replicate that motion in our code, using random slight variations.

## Chemotaxis
### The movement of a motile cell or organism, or part of one, in a direction corresponding to a gradient of increasing or decreasing concentration of a particular substance.
